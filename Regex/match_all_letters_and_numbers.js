// Using character classes, you were able to search for all letters of the alphabet with [a-z]. This kind of character class is common enough that there is a shortcut for it, although it includes a few extra characters as well.
//
// The closest character class in JavaScript to match the alphabet is \w. This shortcut is equal to [A-Za-z0-9_]. This character class matches upper and lowercase letters plus numbers. Note, this character class also includes the underscore character (_).
//
// let longHand = /[A-Za-z0-9_]+/;
// let shortHand = /\w+/;
// let numbers = "42";
// let varNames = "important_var";
// longHand.test(numbers); // Returns true
// shortHand.test(numbers); // Returns true
// longHand.test(varNames); // Returns true
// shortHand.test(varNames); // Returns true
// These shortcut character classes are also known as shorthand character classes.
//
// Use the shorthand character class \w to count the number of alphanumeric characters in various quotes and strings.

let quoteSample = "The five boxing wizards jump quickly.";
let alphabetRegexV2 = /\w/ig;
let result = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegexV2).length;
